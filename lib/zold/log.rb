module Zold
  # Logging facilities.
  #
  # There are a few logging classes, which can be used depending on what
  # you want a user to see. There are three logging levels: INFO, ERROR,
  # and DEBUG. In "quiet" mode the user won't see anything. This logging
  # mode is used only for testing, when we don't want to see absolutely
  # anything in the console. In order to turn off logging entirely, see
  # how we configure it in test__helper.rb
  #
  # The default "regular" logging mode is what a user gets when he/she runs
  # the gem in commmand line without any specific flags. In that case,
  # the user will see only INFO and ERROR messages.
  #
  # In a "verbose" mode the user will see everything, including DEBUG
  # messages. The user turns this mode by using --verbose command line argument.
