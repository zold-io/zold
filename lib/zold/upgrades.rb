module Zold
  # Class to manage data upgrades (when zold itself upgrades).
  #
  # This class will write the version file to the zoldata directory.
  # The version file is a text file containing nothing but the version
  # of the data and a newline. It is named `version`, no extension.
  #
  # If the data is up-to-date, the version of the data is equal to
  # Zold::VERSION.
  #
  # By comparing Zold::VERSION with the data version we determine
  # which upgrade scripts will be executed.
  #
  # If the data version is the same as Zold::VERSION, the data is
  # up to date.
  #
  # If the data version is lower than Zold::VERSION, we will look into
  # the `upgrades/` directory and any scripts from the data version
  # up will be executed.
  #
  # The version of an upgrade script is extracted from the name
  # which is formatted as`<version>.rb`, so for instance `upgrades/0.0.1.rb` etc.
  #
  # If there is no version file, as it would if the data were created
  # by a version of Zold that doesn't have this class implemented yet,
  # all the upgrade scripts have to run.
  #
  # The upgrade scripts are loaded into the running Ruby interpreter
  # rather than being executed.
