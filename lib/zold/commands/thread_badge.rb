module Zold
  # This module should be included in each command, in order to label
  # the current Thread correctly, when the command is running. This is mostly
  # useful for debugging/testing purposes - want to be able to see what's
  # going on in the thread when it gets stuck with a Futex.
  #
  # Since all commands have exactly the same external interface and implement
  # the method "run," we catch all calls to this method and label the
  # current thread properly. We label it back when it's over.
