  s.description = "In the last few years digital currencies have successfully demonstrated \
their ability to become an alternative financial instrument in many \
different markets. Most of the technologies available at the moment are \
based on the principles of Blockchain architecture, including \
dominating currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Despite its \
popularity, Blockchain is not the best possible solution for all scenarios. \
One such example is for fast micro-payments. \
Zold is an experimental alternative that enables distributed transactions between \
anonymous users, making micro-payments financially feasible. \
It borrows the proof-of-work principle from Bitcoin, \
and suggests a different architecture for digital wallet maintenance."
